    <h1>Format for data analysis</h1>
    <p>Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. 
    Open the document 
    <a href="tutorial_spreadsheet.xlsx" download="filename">ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a>
    in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.</p> 
    <p>In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered
    in the first row of each column.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li> 
     <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <strong>unique identifier</strong>.</li> 
     <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters),
       so change <em>4tutorial_types</em> to <em>tutorial_types</em>.</li> 
     <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change
       <em>use</em> and <em>useful</em> to <em>perc_ease_of_use</em>
       and <em>perc_usefulness</em>, respectively.</li>  <li>Your spreadsheet
       should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that
       Column F refers to <em>Perceived Usefulness</em> and Column G  refers
       to <em>Perceived Ease of Use</em>.</li> 
    </ol>

    <p class="caption">Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical
    values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</p>

    <p>Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In gender, change the
       "female" value to "F".</li> 
     <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns.
       For example, <em>tasks_completed values</em> (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into
       three components. So, add columns <em>task1</em>, <em>task2</em>, and <em>task3</em>,
       and reformat values appropriately.</li> 
     <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete
       the old <em>tasks_completed column</em>.</li> 
     <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2</li> 
    </ol>
    <img src="../illustrations/datalesson_fig2.png" 
    alt="image of the same excel file, but the columns task1, task2, and task3 have Y and N values">
    <p class="caption">Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format.</p>

    <p>Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether
    or not the value is represented for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical
    values dichotomous, which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for
    relationships or correlations.</p>
    
    <div class="sidenav">
      <p><strong>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics
        for analysis. For example, separating <em>experience</em> levels allows the
        researcher to test in PASW whether subjects with low experience have
        <em>perceived ease of use</em> scores significantly different from those with
        medium and high experience levels.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <ol>
     <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet
       Formatted_Data.</li> 
     <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <strong>Insert
         > Columns</strong> for each distinct value in categorical data columns
       (<em>tutorial_types</em>, <em>gender</em>, <em>exp_level</em>,
       <em>task1</em>, <em>task2</em>, and <em>task3</em>). You do not have
       to add a new column for <em>task1</em>, <em>task2</em>, and
       <em>task3</em> because their values are already dichotomous.</li> 
     <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy
       and paste the values from the original column.</li> 
     <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using
       the replace function: <strong>Edit > Replace</strong>.</li> 
     <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>
