    <h1>Run descriptive statistics</h1>
    <div class="sidenav">
      <strong>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <em>perc_enjoy</em> is much higher on average than <em>perc_usefulness</em>,
        which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</strong>
    </div>
    
    <p>Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring
    summary, those with <strong>continuous</strong> values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <em>perc_enjoy</em>, <em>perc_usefulness</em>,
    and <em>perc_ease_of_use</em> are already adjacent.)</p>
    <p>Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Add-Ins...</strong> and make sure <strong>Analysis ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click OK.</li>
      <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
      <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables.
    For example, <em>Column 1</em> should be <em>perc_enjoy</em>. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.</p> 
    <p>Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can
    you glean from the summary statistics for <em>perc_usefulness</em> and <em>perc_ease_of_use</em>?</p>

    <p>CAPTION: Excel will not run descriptive statistics with non-numeric characters, so the variable labels must be re-entered.</p>
