   <h1>Local Libraries</h1>

    <p>There are two types of local libraries that my contain your resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Other university libraries belonging to I-Share</li>
      <li>Public libraries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I-Share Libraries</h2>
    <p>Many I-Share libraries will allow you to pull books directly from the shelf
    and check them out instantaneously so long as you can present your IIT ID card
    and there are no holds on your library account. Daley Library at the University
    of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has an <span class="bold-text">open stacks</span>
    policy. UIC is also a <span class="bold-text">Research I institution</span>,
    so their library is quite extensive.</p>

    <p>Not all area libraries belong to the I-Share system. For instance,
    Loyola University and the University of Chicago do not participate in I-Share.
    You may check out books, but only under certain conditions. You may not enter
    their facilities or browse their collections.</p>

    <p>If you plan on visiting an I-Share library to obtain your resource, consider the following:</p>

    <aside class="sidenav">
      <h2>Being Realistic</h2>
      <p><span class="bold-text">Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to
        find out it is closed for break or you are not allowed to browse the stacks
        as a non-student. When in doubt, call first.</span></p> 
    </aside>

    <ul>
     <li><span class="bold-text">Where is the library located?</span></li> 
     <li>Will you have to travel outside of Chicago? If so, consider interlibrary loan.</li> 
     <li><span class="bold-text">Can you enter the library?</span></li> 
     <li>Ask if the library is open to the public. Although you are a registered student
       at an I-Share institution, different libraries have different rules about who
       can browse their book stacks.</li> 
     <li><span class="bold-text">What are the library hours?</span></li> 
     <li>Not every institution uses the semester system. DePaul University, for instance,
       uses the quarter system, so their school is closed at different times than IIT.
       Check the library website to verify hours</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Public Libraries</h2>
    <p>The Chicago Public Library (CPL) system is extensive, and contains a great deal
    of books that are in popular demand or hard to obtain from I-Share libraries
    (e.g. textbooks). If you do not live in Chicago, you cannot check books out of the
    library, but you can visit the library and read or copy the books. Most local
    libraries have similar policies. Visit a CPL location to obtain a library card
    (you will need to present proof of residency).</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from an I-Share Library</h2>
    <p>After finishing another project, Bridgette returns to her research paper
    on Tech Comm prior to World War II. She notices that she had made a note
    to obtain <em>English for Engineers</em> by S. A. Harbarger, but that was
    over a week ago and she now only has ten days left to finish her paper. She
    decides to reassess her research timeline and concludes that she has enough time
    to read, analyze, and incorporate important elements of this resource into her
    paper, but in order to do so, she must have the resource and begin working
    immediately.</p>
    <p>Recognizing the need for an adjustment in the amount of time it takes her to obtain
    the resource, she decides to attempt to pick up the book herself from a local library.
    She sees a note she made that the book is available at the UIC library; since she has
    the title, author, local library, and call number, she is ready to proceed to the library.
    Prior to leaving, however, she checks the hours and policies of the UIC library on their
    website so she doesn't waste a trip.</p>

    <h2>When to Use Local Library Resources Instead of Interlibrary Loan</h2>
    <p>There are two situations where you should consider obtaining your resource
    through a local library rather than relying on interlibrary loan:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You no longer have enough time to wait for an interlibrary loan book to be delivered</li>
      <li>You cannot obtain the book through interlibrary loan because it is not available</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is important to remember that CPL volumes are <em>not</em> listed in I-Share
    holdings information. Even though public libraries are located in Illinois, they
    do not participate in the I-Share system, so you must search at the CPL website to 
    view available titles.</p>
