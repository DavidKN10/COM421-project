   <h1>Requesting Resources</h1>
    
    <h2>Requesting Articles</h2>
    <p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download
    as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine, as is the case in the
    figure below:</p>

    <p>Clicking on the <span class="bold-text">Get Article</span> link will direct you to a page
    like this, where you will either be able to retrieve the article through another
    web site or where you will request the article through your myILL account.</p>

    <img src="../illustrations/research4_image2.jpg" 
    alt="image of a page that shows ways to retrieve a selected article or requesting it">
    <p class="caption">For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL</p>

    <p>Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so you
    will need to register before you are able to request an article. Think of myILL
    as asking a friend to make a copy of an article for you, because that is essentially
    what you are doing. You will be notified by email when your article is ready to download,
    and you can log into myILL and view your page of delivered items. For more help
    requesting articles, see the Library FAQ and How-to Pages.</p>

    <h2>Requesting a Book From Another Library</h2>
    <p>When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT library
    system. If you are unsuccessful in finding the title you are looking for, next
    try to locate the book in <span class="bold-text">I-Share</span>. If I-Share yields no results,
    the next step is to search for your book in <span class="bold-text">WorldCat</span>.</p>

      <h2><strong>Being Relistic</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>When collecting resources, don't assume that you will remember
        any of the titles you look up or that you will be able to find them again
        using past searches. Keep a list of resources on Google Documents or on
        your flash drive.</strong></p>
    </aside>

    <p>If you are confused when using any of the library systems, you can always
    refer back to the Library FAQ and How-to Pages which have a selection of tutorials
    explaining the step-by-step instructions for requesting resources.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h2>
    <p>Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through them.
    One of the resources that Jane finds quoted often in academic papers is the 1923
    text English for Engineers written by S. A. Harbarger. She decides that this is
    a useful resource to examine for her project, and makes a note of the title, author,
    and year in her Google Docs list of resources that she is compiling. After a quick
    search in I-Share, she notices that it is available at the University of Illinois
    library in Chicago; she makes a note of this as well in her list of resources.
    Although she has to work on another project, she knows that she can easily come
    back to her research notes and resume work.</p>
